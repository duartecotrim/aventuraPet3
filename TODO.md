# TODO: Integrate main.ejs and principal.ejs side by side

- [x] Modify app/views/aventura-pet/index.ejs to use flexbox layout with left (menu) and right (pet card) columns, including main.ejs always on left and principal.ejs conditionally on right if data is provided.
- [x] Update app/controller/aventuraPetController.js index function to fetch pet data similar to viewPets and pass it to the view.
- [x] Add container div to app/views/aventura-pet/main.ejs for styling the left column.
- [x] Update public/css/principalstyles.css to support the new dashboard layout and ensure responsiveness.
- [x] Test the integration by running the app and checking the /aventura-pet route (app started successfully on localhost:3000).
